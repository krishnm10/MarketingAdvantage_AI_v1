Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, revered globally as Mahatma Gandhi, was a pioneering leader of the Indian independence movement and a global icon of peace. Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, he dedicated his life to the principles of Truth (Satya) and Non-violence (Ahimsa). After studying law in London, he began his activism in South Africa, where he developed the technique of Satyagraha—non-violent civil disobedience—to fight racial discrimination. 
Upon returning to India in 1915, Gandhi became the central figure in the struggle against British rule, leading monumental campaigns such as the Salt March and the Quit India Movement. Known affectionately as Bapu or the "Father of the Nation," he championed simple living, wearing hand-spun khadi to promote economic self-reliance. Though he was assassinated on January 30, 1948, his legacy lives on, inspiring world leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela in their own quests for justice.
